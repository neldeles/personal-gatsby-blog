I've been looking for a way to airplay videos on my Mac to my Apple TV.

The best app I've come across so far is [Sodaplayer](https://www.sodaplayer.com/).

It has worked flawlessly for me so far. It also has some standout features such as the ability to stream BitTorrent videos (no more waiting for the download to finish) and AceStream support.
