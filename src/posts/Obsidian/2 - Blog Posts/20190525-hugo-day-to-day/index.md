Managing the blog is done via Terminal. These are the key commands I've encountered so far.

## Adding links to your site menu

Open your `config.toml` file and add in:

```toml
[menu]
  [[menu.main]]
    name = "About"
    url  = "about"
    pre = "<i class='fa fa-heart'></i>"
    weight = 1

  [[menu.main]]
    name = "Articles"
    url  = "articles/"
    weight = 10

  [[menu.main]]
    name = "Blog"
    url  = "blog/"
    weight = 20

  [[menu.main]]
    name = "Home"
    url  = "/"
    weight = 30

  [[menu.main]]
    name = "Tutorials"
    url  = "tutorials/"
    weight = 100
```

Note that this is dependent on your theme. In Cactus Plus this doesn't work (because the template isn't set up as such). However for my previous theme that I used, Paper, it did work.

## Creating a new post

Whenever I want to create a new post, I change my current working directory to the local project, then create a new post via:

```bash
cd my_blog

hugo new posts/new-post.md
```

Note that `draft` is set to `false` by default for the posts. Hugo will not publish these. More info [here](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/usage/).

### Adding images to your post

Put them in the `static` folder. Recommended set up is within `static/img` and subdirectories with names identical to post slugs i.e.:

```
/content/future-of-bali.md
/static/img/future-of-bali/green-school-power-plant.jpg
```

### Adding article description/summary

Specific to my Cactus Plus theme, if I wish to add a post summary:

> To use the content summary, you may add the `<!--more-->` summary divider where you want to split the article alternatively. For org content, use `#` more where you want to split the article. Content that comes before the summary divider will be used as that contentâ€™s summary.By default, Hugo automatically takes the first 70 words of your content as its summary.

### Building the website (and therefore post)

Once your article is ready, you will need to `build` the files. This creates the `public` subfolder, which is basically the complete website and is what you deploy.

You build via running `hugo` in terminal i.e.:

```bash
hugo
```

### Commit and push

Once it's been built, next step is to use Git to commit to the repository. For this I prefer using Github Desktop. ![commit](./commit.png)

## Changing your blog's theme

Add it to your `themes` folder via:

```bash
cd themes
git submodule add https://github.com/nodejh/hugo-theme-cactus-plus.git
```

Then open your `config.toml` file and make sure the `theme` name is exactly the same as the folder name in the `themes` directory.

\*For my switch to Cactus Plus, I had to change the `default.md` archetype too. Make sure to revert if I switch themes again.
