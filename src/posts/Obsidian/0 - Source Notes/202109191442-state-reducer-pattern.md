# State Reducer pattern
A pattern in React popularized by Kent Dodds, which allows us to implement the computer science principle of [Inversion of Control](202109061436-compound-components.md).

Initially used [render props](202109182011-render-props.md), but after the introduction of Hooks, it now uses that instead.
