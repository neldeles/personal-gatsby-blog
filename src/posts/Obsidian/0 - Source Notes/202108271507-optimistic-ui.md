# Optimistic UI
> What percent of mutation requests (requests intended to make a change to data) in your app are successful? 50%? 70%? 90%? 99%? I would argue that the vast majority of requests users make in your apps are successful (if not, then you have other problems to deal with... like annoyed users). With that in mind, wouldn't it make sense to assume that the request is going to succeed and make the UI appear as if it had? Successful until proven otherwise?

> This pattern is called "Optimistic UI" and it's a great way to make users feel like your app is lightning fast. Unfortunately it often comes with a lot of challenges primarily due to race-conditions.
