# YNAB Reset Budgeted vs Reset Available Amounts
Let's say that you budgeted 100 towards a category in April, but you have 100 leftover in March. When you move forward to April, you'll see 100 in the budgeted column, and 200 in the available column.

If you click Reset Budgeted Amounts, that will change the 100 budgeted for April only. So, 100 would move back to To be Budgeted, and 100 would still be in the category from March.

If you click Reset Available Amounts, then that will take the full 200 out of the category and move it back to To be Budgeted.

I would recommend going through each month, selecting all categories, and resetting. budgeted amounts to zero. That will only change the month you are in, you will not lose budgeting history for previous months.

## How far back does reset available amounts extend to?
So, if you move forward into April, for example, and do that, you'll see all the money move to To be Budgeted.

\*But\*

if you go back to March, the money will still be there. The change doesn't happen until the month you made the change.

so let's say I only spend 50 for March. It's April now. My to be budgeted for April will be 150?

That's correct. If you spend 50 in March, 50 would rollover into April. Resetting Available would bring April's To be Budgeted to 150.

Resetting Budgeted would bring it to 50.

Because only March would be leftover.
