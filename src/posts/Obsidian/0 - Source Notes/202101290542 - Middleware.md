# Middleware 
- functions that can be used for handling _request_ and _response_ objects
- can use several middleware at the same time

## Middleware in Express
Sample middleware that prints info about ever request sent to the server:
```js
const requestLogger = (request, response, next) => {
  console.log('Method:', request.method)
  console.log('Path:  ', request.path)
  console.log('Body:  ', request.body)
  console.log('---')
  next()
}

// taken into use like this:
app.use(requestLogger)
```
- in `express`, when you have multiple middlewares, they are executed one by one in the order they were taken into use
	- order matters
- middleware functions have to be taken into use before routes **if we want them to be executed before the route event handlers are called**
- there are also situations where we want to define middleware functions after routes
	- in practice, this means that we are defining middleware functions that are only called if no route handles the HTTP request

Example middleware defined after routes:
```js
const express = require('express')
const app = express()

app.use(express.json())

const requestLogger = (request, response, next) => {
  console.log('Method:', request.method)
  console.log('Path:  ', request.path)
  console.log('Body:  ', request.body)
  console.log('---')
  next()
}

const unknownEndpoint = (request, response) => {
  response.status(404).send({ error: 'unknown endpoint' })
}

app.use(requestLogger)

//....

app.use(unknownEndpoint)

const PORT = 3001
app.listen(PORT, () => {
  console.log(`Server running on port ${PORT}`)
})
```
- note how it was only taken into use at the end after all routes, acting as a catch-all last resort
