# `instanceof` 
- allows you to compare an object to a constructor, returning `true` or `false` based on whether or not that object was created with the constructor
```js
let Bird = function(name, color) {
  this.name = name;
  this.color = color;
  this.numLegs = 2;
}

let crow = new Bird("Alexis", "black");

crow instanceof Bird; // => true
```
