	- initialization
		- for defining and setup of the loop variable
	- condition
		- condition to be evaluated at beginning of every loop iteration
		- stops when condition is false at start of iteration
	- final expression
		- executed at end of each loop iteration
```js
var ourArray = [];
for (var i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  ourArray.push(i);
}
```
