#  reducer (redux)
- a function which is given the current state and an action as parameters
	- ==reducers must be [[202012280515 - Mutations and Side Effects| pure functions]]==
- *returns* a new state
- reducer never supposed to be called directly from the application's code
	- as such, reducer is only given as a parameter to the `createStore` function which creates the store:
```js
import { createStore } from 'redux'

const counterReducer = (state = 0, action) => {
  switch(action.type) {
    case 'INCREMENT':
      return state + 1
    case 'DECREMENT':
      return state - 1
    case 'ZERO':
      return 0
    default:
      return state
  }
}

const store = createStore(counterReducer)
```

## Use `switch` statements
Customary to use a [[202011221655 - Switch Statements|switch]] statement instead of `if` in a reducer.

Example:
```js
const counterReducer = (state = 0, action) => {
  switch(action.type) {
    case 'INCREMENT':
      return state + 1
    case 'DECREMENT':
      return state - 1
    case 'ZERO':
      return 0
    default:
      return state
  }
}
```

Why? Because when you're handling multiple actions, `switch` is easier to read. For example:
```js
const noteReducer = (state = [], action) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'NEW_NOTE':
      return state.concat(action.data)
    case 'TOGGLE_IMPORTANCE': {
      const id = action.data.id
      const noteToChange = state.find(n => n.id === id)
      const changedNote = {
        ...noteToChange,
        important: !noteToChange.important
      }
      return state.map(note =>
        note.id !== id ? note : changedNote
      )
    }
    default:
      return state
  }
}
```

## Reducers as pure functions
Bad example:
```js
const noteReducer = (state = [], action) => {
  if (action.type === 'NEW_NOTE') {
    state.push(action.data)
    return state
  }

  return state
}
```
Good example:
```js
const noteReducer = (state = [], action) => {
  if (action.type === 'NEW_NOTE') {
    return state.concat(action.data)
  }

  return state
}
```
Difference between good and bad example is we added a new note to the state with the method `state.push(action.data)` which _changes_ the state of the state object. Should use `concat` instead.
