# 202102190653 - Axios Library
Javascript library used to make HTTP requests from node.js.
## What it aims to improve: .fetch()
Fetch uses a two-step process when dealing with JSON data; after making an initial request you’ll then need to call the .json() method on the response in order to receive the actual data object. If I were to have a fetch request to get back an object of relevant drivers for my carpool sourcing app, I might have something like the following:

```js
const baseUrl = 'http://localhost:3000/api/v1'
fetch(`${baseUrl}/drivers`).then(res => res)
```
This would return a pending promise and response object letting me know my request was successful, but where’s my data?! We have to remember to pass our response to the `.json()` method as well.
```js
const baseUrl = 'http://localhost:3000/api/v1'
fetch(`${baseUrl}/drivers`).then(res => res.json())
```
## Better error handling
There’s some extra work we need to put in on our end (again, it could be argued that this is just a matter of syntax memorization) for the desired result when it comes to properly logging response errors with `.fetch()`. [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch#Checking_that_the_fetch_was_successful) explains:

> A `[fetch()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/GlobalFetch/fetch)` promise will reject with a `[TypeError](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/TypeError)` when a network error is encountered or CORS is misconfigured on the server side, although this usually means permission issues or similar — a 404 does not constitute a network error, for example.

Let’s assume there’s something wrong with our `baseUrl` variable. The expectation of the output for the following code block would be _error_, but instead it’s _ok._ Why is this?
```js
const baseUrl = '[http://localhost:3000/api/v1'](http://localhost:3000/api/v1')fetch(\`${baseUrl}/drivers\`)  
    .catch(error => console.log('ok'))  
    .then(res => console.log('error'));
```
It turns out `fetch()` only rejects promises in relatively rare networking error situations like a DNS lookup failure. Luckily `fetch()` provides a simple `ok` flag that indicates whether or not the status code of a response is in the successful range. Generally what happens is you’ll end up writing a one-size-fits-all error handling function to be used on all of your `fetch()` calls.
## In Summary
By using axios we remove the need to pass the results of the HTTP request to the `.json()` method. Axios simply returns the data object you expect straight away. Additionally, any kind of error with an HTTP request will successfully execute the `.catch()` block right out of the box.
