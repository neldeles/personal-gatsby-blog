# Cypress `.contains` 
## How it works
When chained, the second `contains` command `continues` the search from within the component found by the first command. ^69fcb5

If we had not chained the commands, and instead wrote

```js
cy.contains('second note')
cy.contains('make important').click()
```

the result would have been totally different.
