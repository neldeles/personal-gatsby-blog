# Define your business requirements
Here's an example for a TODO app:

> Let's start by figuring out the initial business requirements for this application:
> -   The UI should consist of three main sections:
>        -   An input box to let the user type in the text of a new todo item
>        -   A list of all the existing todo items
>        -   A footer section that shows the number of non-completed todos, and shows filtering options
> -   Todo list items should have a checkbox that toggles their "completed" status. We should also be able to add a color-coded category tag for a predefined list of colors, and delete todo items.
> -   The counter should pluralize the number of active todos: "0 items", "1 item", "3 items", etc
> -   There should be buttons to mark all todos as completed, and to clear all completed todos by removing them
> -   There should be two ways to filter the displayed todos in the list:
>       -   Filtering based on showing "All", "Active", and "Completed" todos
>       -   Filtering based on selecting one or more colors, and showing any todos whose tag that match those colors
