#  actions (redux)
- in charge of changing the state in the store
- are objects which have at least a field determing the `type` of the action

## Example of a simple action
```js
{
	type: 'INCREMENT'
}
```
## Example of an action with data
```js
{
  type: 'NEW_NOTE',
  data: {
    content: 'state changes are made with actions',
    important: false,
    id: 2
  }
}
```
