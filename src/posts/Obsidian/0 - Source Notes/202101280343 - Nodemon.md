# Nodemon
If we make changes to the application's code we have to restart the application in order to see the changes. We restart the application by first shutting it down by typing _Ctrl+C_ and then restarting the application. Compared to the convenient workflow in React where the browser automatically reloaded after changes were made, this feels slightly cumbersome.

The solution to this problem is [nodemon](https://github.com/remy/nodemon):

> _nodemon will watch the files in the directory in which nodemon was started, and if any files change, nodemon will automatically restart your node application._
