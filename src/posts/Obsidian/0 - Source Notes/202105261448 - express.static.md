# express.static()
Allows us to serve static content from a directory we specify. Many ways to specify the directory. Here are a few examples:

```js
// ~/index.js

// absolute path
const express = require("express");
const app = express();
const cors = require("cors");
const pool = require("./db");
const path = require('path')
const PORT = process.env.PORT || 5000

if (process.env.NODE_ENV === "production") {
  //serve static content
  //npm run build
  app.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname, "client/build")));
}
```
`__dirname` refers to the directory of the current file. In our case it's the *index.js* file in the root directory.

```js
app.use(express.static('client/build'))
```
`express.static` is relative depending on where the node process is launched. In this example our node process (or `app.listen`) is located in *~/index.js* so by relative it's in the root directory. Hence this is why the above also works. A longhand way of writing this is:
```js
app.use('/', express.static('client/build'))
```
