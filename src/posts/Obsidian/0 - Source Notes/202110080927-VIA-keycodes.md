# VIA Keycodes

Some QMK keycodes are not understood by VIA. These are the ones I've successfully used so far:

Multiple Keypress 
- `A(KC_LEFT)`
- you need to use the abbreviated keycode not `KC_ALT`

Layer toggle on hold, keypress on tap
- `LT(1,KC_ENT)`

Mod Tap 
- keypress on tap, modifier on hold
- `MT(MOD_LGUI | MOD_LALT, KC_C)`

Modifiers Only
- use `KC_NO` as the keypress
	- i.e. if you want command and shift it's `G(S(KC_NO))`
