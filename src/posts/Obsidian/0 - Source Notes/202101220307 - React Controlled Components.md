# React Controlled Components
Using controlled components is one way of accessing data contained in a form's `input` element.

My understanding of what a controlled component is: HTML form elements maintain their own state. While in React, mutable state is kept in the state property of components. So we combine the two and make React the single source of truth.

If a HTML form's state is controlled by React, it is called a **controlled component.**
