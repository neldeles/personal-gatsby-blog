# GTD and Hyperscheduling Workflow
Current workflow I'm trying out is using Sorted and Things together. I throw all my tasks in Things, then when I wake up, first thing I do is use a Shortcuts workflow to import all my *Today* tasks in Things to Sorted. I then hyperschedule my day.

Cons though are that I need to complete the task in 2 places, and if I add a new Today task in Things I need to manually add it in Sorted as well. This is why the ff workflow caught my attention. It allows you to do a softer hyperschedule by using general time blocks in Calendar and tags in Things:

> I use time blocking by scheduling my blocks in Apple Calendar - which can be displayed at the top of Things Today view. Time blocks are the WHEN and Things records the WHAT.

A more specific example of the above:
> The way I personally take care of that is by tagging these big tasks with the tag ‘Focus time’ in Things, and then have a few 2 hour events labelled ‘Focus time’ in my calendar through the week. When one of those starts, I start filter my Things tasks by that label and start chipping away. 
> 
> Also, I realised a few years back that if a task I mark down in Things is too large (>30 mins), it usually just never gets done, so I try to split them into small chunks as much as I can. The Areas > Projects > Tasks > Subtasks structure in Things really helps with doing that in an organised way.
