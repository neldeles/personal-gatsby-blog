# Switch Statements 
- if you have many options to choose from
- tests a value and can have many `case` statements which define various possible values
	- executed from the first matched `case` value until a `break` is encountered
- can add the `default` statement which acts like an `else` statement
	- also added as the last case

```js
switch (num) {
  case value1:
    statement1;
    break;
  case value2:
    statement2;
    break;
...
  default:
    defaultStatement;
    break;
}
```
