# Installing Autojump

I wanted a way to easily navigate directories in Terminal. Setting variables/aliases was one solution but then I'd have to keep updating it.

I discovered a package called Autojump which solves this problem. You only need to have visited that folder once. Then it builds a database of these directories you've visited so it's easy to navigate to it next time.
