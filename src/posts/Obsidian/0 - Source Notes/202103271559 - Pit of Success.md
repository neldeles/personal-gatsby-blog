# Pit of Success
> The Pit of Success: in stark contrast to a summit, a peak, or a journey across a desert to find victory through many trials and surprises, we want our customers to simply fall into winning practices by using our platform and frameworks. To the extent that we make it easy to get into trouble we fail.

It should be hard for your user to fail and commit mistakes. **Doing the right thing is easy, and doing the wrong thing is hard.**
