# `useContext` 
`useContext` is of course the React Hook way to consume [React Context](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html). It's a way to share data to any descendent component without having to manually pass the props through every intermediary component. Sometimes known as [prop drilling](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/prop-drilling).

## Why do I need Context?

The [React docs](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html) have a wonderful and succinct explanation:

> Context provides a way to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level.

Example usually help me understand things best. Notice in this example how we have to pass both `dispatch` and `isLoggedIn` to `TodoPage` so that it can then in turn give it to each `TodoItem`.

What's unfortunate about this is that `TodoPage` has no need for `dispatch` or `isLoggedIn`. The only reason it's being given those values is so it can pass it along. This is props drilling.

```js
export default function App() {
  const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(loginReducer, initialState);
  const { todos, isLoggedIn } = state;
  return (
    <div className="App useContext">
      <TodoPage todos={todos} dispatch={dispatch} isLoggedIn={isLoggedIn} />
    </div>
  );
}

function TodoPage({ todos, dispatch, isLoggedIn }) {
  return (
    <div className="todoContainer">
      <h2>Todos</h2>
      {todos.map((item) => (
        <TodoItem
          key={item.title}
          dispatch={dispatch}
          isLoggedIn={isLoggedIn}
          {...item}
        />
      ))}
    </div>
  );
}

function TodoItem({ title, completed, dispatch, isLoggedIn }) {
  const isLoggedIn = true;
  return (
    <div className="todoItem">
      <p>{title}</p>
      <div>
        <input
          type="checkbox"
          checked={completed}
          onClick={() => {
            if (!isLoggedIn) {
              alert('Please login to click this!');
            }
          }}
          onChange={() => {
            if (isLoggedIn) {
              dispatch({ type: 'toggleTodoCompleted', payload: title });
            }
          }}
        />
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## How Context Helps

Context removes the need for us to pass props to components that don't need it. It essentially lets some parent component expose a value to any descendent component. The big thing about context is the descendent doesn't have to be an immediate child, it can be as deep in the React component tree as you like.

==This is essentially the third way you can store and share data in React. There's state, props, and context.== Context isn't something that you should feel the need to use frequently, however knowing it exists, and knowing why you might want to use it, is extremely valuable to have in your toolbox.
