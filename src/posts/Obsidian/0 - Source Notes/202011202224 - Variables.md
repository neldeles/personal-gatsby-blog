# Variables

## Javascript
We can declare a variable without assigning the variable a value. In such a case, the variable will be automatically initialized with a value of undefined:

```js
let price;
console.log(price); // Output: undefined
price = 350;
console.log(price); // Output: 350
```

### `var` keyword
- using `var` you can overwrite variables without an error
	- when your code becomes larger, you might accidentally overwrite a variable that you did not intend to overwrite
	- solution is to use the [[202011300348 - let keyword|let keyword]]

```js
var camper = 'James';
var camper = 'David';
console.log(camper);
// logs 'David'
```
#### Scope 
- scope of `var` is [[202011202207 - JavaScript Global Scope|global]]

### Important
Minimizing mutable state will help lessen sources of potential problems therefore always try and use `const`, which prevents re-assignment. When declaring a variable, always ask yourself: will this variable need to be re-assigned in the future? If not, use `const`. If it will need to be re-assigned, use `let`. Never use `var`.
