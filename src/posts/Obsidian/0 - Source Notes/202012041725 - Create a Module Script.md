# Create a Module Script
- ES6 introduced a way to easily share code among JavaScript files
- This involves exporting parts of a file for use in one or more other files, and importing the parts you need, where you need them. 
- In order to take advantage of this functionality, you need to create a script in your HTML document with a type of module: `<script type="module" src="filename.js"></script>`
	- can now use the `import` and `export` features in the script
