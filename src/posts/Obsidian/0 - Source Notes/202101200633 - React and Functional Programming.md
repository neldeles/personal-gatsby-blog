# React and Functional Progamming 
When using React, techniques from functional programming are often used. One characteristic of the functional programming paradigm is the use of [immutable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immutable_object) data structures. In React code, it is preferable to use the method [concat](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/concat), which does not add the item to the array, but creates a new array in which the content of the old array and the new item are both included.
