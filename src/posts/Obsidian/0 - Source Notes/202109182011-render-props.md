# Render Props
> A render prop is simply a function prop that is called in a [render method](202109191200-render-method.md).

In code:
```js
const Dismiss = (props) => {
  const dismiss = () => {
    ...code to implement dismissal animations etc
  }

  return props.render(dismiss)
}

const DismissableContent = () => {
  return (
    <Dismiss render={
      dismiss => <Content dismiss={dismiss} />
    } />
  )
}
```

> Fundamentally, **render props solves the problem of react component logic code reuse**
This is the same problem that [Custom Hooks](Custom%20Hooks.md) tries to solve, so for using >= react@16.8.0 it's recommended to just use Hooks.

This is called. It returns a call to the render prop, ergo the render prop aka the function prop returns the <Content /> component with the dismiss function passed as a prop.
