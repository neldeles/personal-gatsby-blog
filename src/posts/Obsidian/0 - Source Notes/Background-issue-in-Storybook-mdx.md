# Background addon and MDX

Found a blocker to fully transitioning to MDX docs. Will use CSF in meantime. The issue is that the Background addon doesn't work with MDX stories. So if you try to change the background, nothing happens.

There is a current unresolved issue for this in Github:
- https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/issues/14322
