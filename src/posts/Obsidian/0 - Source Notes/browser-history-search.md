# Browser history search

Researching on apps that will track my browser history search. Basically fetching.io (since that app died).

- flamory 
	- windows only
- memex
	- deprecated their browser history search feature; now only works across saved links
- heyday.xyz
	- haven't tried but price is prohibitive
