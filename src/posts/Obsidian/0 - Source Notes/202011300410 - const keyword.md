# `const` keyword
- introduced in ES6
- cannot be reassigned because it is constant
	- if you try to reassign a `const` variable, you’ll get a `TypeError`
	- **only prevents re-assignment— objects and arrays are still mutable**
		- there is a function to prevent [[202011300421 - Preventing Data Mutation| data mutation]]
```js
const s = [5, 6, 7];
s = [1, 2, 3]; // throws error, trying to assign a const
s[2] = 45; // works just as it would with an array declared with var or let
console.log(s); // returns [5, 6, 45]
```
- constant variables must be assigned a value when declared
	- if you try to declare a `const` variable without a value, you’ll get a `SyntaxError`

```js
const FAV_PET = "Cats";
FAV_PET = "Dogs"; // returns error
```
- practice is to use *underscore* and *upper case*
