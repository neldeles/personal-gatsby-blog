# `All` story

I want a story that displays all variants of my component in a single story.

The problem I encountered is how do I add spacing between each variant, without changing the styles of the compnent directly.

Doing so via decorators is not possible because decorators are on a story level, and I am not nesting at a story levelâ€”only component level.

Solution I found in the [Storybook example](https://github.com/storybookjs/design-system/blob/master/src/components/Input.stories.tsx) is to use a one-off HOC.

```jsx
/** @jsxImportSource @emotion/react */

import tw from "twin.macro";
// we rename this as an UnstyledInput
import { Input as UnstyledInput } from ".";

export default {
  // some code here
};

const Input = (props) => (
  <div tw="mb-2">
    <UnstyledInput {...props} />
  </div>
);

const Template = (args) => <Input {...args} />;

export const All = () => {
  return (
    <>
      <Input />
      <Input placeholder="With placeholder" />
      <Input value="With value" />
      <Input value="Disabled" disabled />
    </>
  );
};
```
