# Git push or pull`-u` flag
```
git push -u origin new-feature
```

This command pushes new-feature to the central repository (origin), and the -u flag adds it as a remote tracking branch. After setting up the tracking branch, `git push` can be invoked without any parameters to automatically push the new-feature branch to the central repository.

In other words, we'll be able to just type moving forward:
```shell
git push
```
