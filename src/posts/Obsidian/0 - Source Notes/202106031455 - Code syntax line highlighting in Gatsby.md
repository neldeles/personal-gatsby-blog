# Code syntax line highlighting in Gatsby
The Markdown syntax is the following: next to the specification of the language, between brackets `{}`, the lines should be provided in a comma separated list. A single line can be provided (for example `dart{1}`) or multiple one, from and to being separated with a dash (for example `javascript{3-6}`). Both single or multiple lines can be mixed (for example `typescript{2, 3,4, 7, 8-15}`).
