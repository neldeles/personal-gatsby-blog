# Why CSS-in-JS
Key points for me:
- **Confidence:** Add, change and delete CSS without any unexpected consequences and avoid dead code.
- **Painless Maintenance:** Never go on a hunt for CSS affecting your components ever again.
- **Enhanced Teamwork:** Avoid common CSS frustrations to keep a neat codebase and moving quickly, regardless of experience levels.
- **Fast Performance:** Send only the critical CSS to the user for a rapid first paint.
- **Dynamic Styling:** Simply style your components with a global theme or based on different states.
