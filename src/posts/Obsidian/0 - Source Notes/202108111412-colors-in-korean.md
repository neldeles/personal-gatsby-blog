# Colors in korean
Colors in korean are actually descriptive verbs. That's why you can end sentences with colors in the 있다 form. For example: *연필이 노랗습니다.*

You can then conjugate it to an adjective: *노란 바나나*

To make it a noun, you just add *색* which means color. 

The transformation is then descriptive verbs -> adjectives -> noun.

> All colors ending in 색 can actually be used as adjectives as well. The meaning is the same.
