# Kensington Expert Mouse Trackball Config

My Kensington Expert Mouse Wireless arrived today. To set it up I installed software called Steermouse. I plan to use this with both my left and right hand, so I made sure to make it ambidextrous i.e. the bottom left and bottom right buttons are Primary Clicks. 

Currently, I have set it up as follows:
- bottom left: Secondary Click
- bottom right: Secondary Click
- top left: Primary Click
- top right: Primary Click
- bottom left + top right: auto scroll
- bottom right + top left: auto scroll

In BetterTouchTool:
- cmd + scroll down: next tab in Chrome
- cmd + scroll up: previous tab in Chrome
