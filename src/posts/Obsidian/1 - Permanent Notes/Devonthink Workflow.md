# DevonThink Workflow

## Indexing
Create a top-level folder in finder and store everything in here. That way if I need to move files around, the indexing is maintained and errors encountered will be minimized. [Source](https://talk.macpowerusers.com/t/advice-please-index-or-not-in-devonthink-through-the-finder/16067).

## Receipts, Bills, Licenses

If digital, most likely received via email. Use Spark's Save as PDF to preserve the formatting.
